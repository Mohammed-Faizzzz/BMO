# Coding Challenges Practice

This repository is my personal space dedicated to solving various coding challenges. My primary goal is to **sharpen my software engineering skills**, deepen my understanding of computer science concepts, and gain hands-on experience with practical system design. Each challenge I tackle will have its own dedicated folder, containing my solution along with notes and insights from my learning process.

## Challenges I'm Working On

### 1\. Build Your Own Load Balancer

  * **Source:** [codingchallenges.fyi](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-load-balancer)
  * **My Focus:** This challenge is helping me understand the fundamentals of distributed systems and network programming. I'm building a basic application layer load balancer to learn about efficient request distribution, high availability, and fault tolerance.
  * **Key Aspects I'm Implementing:**
      * **Basic Proxy Server:** Learning how to listen for incoming connections and forward them.
      * **Concurrency:** Practicing handling multiple client connections simultaneously.
      * **Round-Robin Scheduling:** Implementing a classic algorithm for distributing requests.
      * **Health Checks:** Understanding how to monitor backend server health and dynamically manage available resources.
  * **My Solution Folder:** `load-balancer`

## How to Explore My Solutions

Feel free to browse\! If you'd like to run any of my solutions, navigate into the respective challenge folder. Each one will have its own `README.md` with specific instructions on how to set it up and run it. Generally, you'll need the relevant programming language runtime installed (e.g., Python, Go, Node.js) and any project-specific dependencies.

## My Goals for This Repo

  * **Deepen Understanding:** Really solidify my grasp of core computer science principles.
  * **Improve Problem-Solving:** Get better at breaking down complex problems and designing effective solutions.
  * **Learn New Tech:** Experiment with new languages, frameworks, and tools as challenges demand.
  * **Build a Portfolio:** Create a collection of practical projects that demonstrate my growing abilities as a software engineer.
